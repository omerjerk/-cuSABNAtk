## About

cuSABNAtk is the CUDA-based extension of the [SABNAtk framework](https://gitlab.com/SCoRe-Group/SABNAtk). Currently it is still work in progress and hence we are not providing documentation yet :-) However, performance is already awesome, so feel free to try it!

We hope to get first stable release within weeks, at which point this project will be merged into SABNAtk.

If you have immediate questions, please do not hesitate to contact Jaric Zola <jaroslaw.zola@hush.com>.

Stay tuned!
